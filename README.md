#ifndef TAVENGINE_TODO
#define TAVENGINE_TODO

typedef char *TAVENGINE "TODO";

- STOP ABUSING POINTERS IN TAV ENGINE, USE REFERENCES MORE OFTEN TO MAKE FASTER YES YES YES
- SKYBOX
- ADD MODEL LOADING SUPPORT (POSSIBLY ASSIMP IDK YET)
 - IF YOU CODE UR OWN:
    - MODEL, ANIMATIONS support
- AABB's FOR LATER USE (SUPER USEFUL) might be fun as well little treat after working hard on model support :)
- Selecting SceneObject's with cursor
- Highlighting SceneObject's with cursor
- Transform (X,Y,Z) slider (user-interface) tool
  - If this was not so hard complete following: (Rotation, and Scaling) as well
- Quick Color selector on object itself (for fun) really test yourself here if you can..
- Test UI Element's and make sure they can despawn and respawn.
- Make a Side panel that load's by default & can be closed with [X] button or toggled w/ the 'ESC' key
  Side panel will contain info about the Game, Number of Scene Objects, number of shaders loaded, these shaders will be listed, sceneobjects will be listed, everything will be clickable, and hopefully like a tree
- LIGHTING IS NEXT GET READY MF
- THEN PHYSICS OH NO
- (NOT ORDERED HERE) DRAG & DROP assets into the scene hiarchy & into the scene itself..

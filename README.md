- SKYBOX [COMPLETED]
- MODEL3D [WORK IN PROGRESS]
- AABB's FOR LATER USE (SUPER USEFUL) might be fun as well little treat after working hard on model support :)
- Selecting SceneObject's with cursor
- Highlighting SceneObject's with cursor
- Transform (X,Y,Z) slider (user-interface) tool
  - If this was not so hard complete following: (Rotation, and Scaling) as well
- Quick Color selector on object itself (for fun) really test yourself here if you can..
- Make a Side panel that load's by default & can be closed with [X] button or toggled w/ the 'ESC' key
  Side panel will contain info about the Game, Number of Scene Objects, number of shaders loaded, these shaders will be listed, sceneobjects will be listed, everything will be clickable, and hopefully like a tree
- LIGHTING IS NEXT GET READY MF
- THEN PHYSICS OH NO
- (NOT ORDERED HERE) DRAG & DROP assets into the scene hiarchy & into the scene itself..
